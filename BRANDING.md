# Movescrow Branding Guide

## Logo Analysis

### Visual Elements

1. **Graphic Emblem**:
   - **Dark Blue "M"**: Stylized capital letter "M" with modern, angular design
   - **Speed Lines**: Three horizontal lines extending from the left side of the "M", decreasing in length from top to bottom, creating a visual effect of movement and speed
   - **Orange Shield**: Overlapping the lower central portion of the "M", symbolizing security and protection
   - **White Keyhole Icon**: Centrally placed within the orange shield, representing security, trust, and access control

2. **Typography**:
   - **Font**: Bold, serif-like font
   - **Color Split**: 
     - "Move" in **Dark Blue**
     - "scrow" in **Orange**

### Brand Identity

The logo combines two key brand values:
- **Movement & Speed**: Represented by the "M" with speed lines
- **Security & Trust**: Represented by the shield and keyhole icon

This perfectly aligns with Movescrow's core value proposition: fast, reliable logistics with secure escrow payments.

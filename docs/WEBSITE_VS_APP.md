# Website vs Mobile App - Strategic Decision

## 🎯 Recommendation: **MOBILE APP FIRST** ✅

### Why Mobile App is Priority

#### 1. **Core Product Requirements**
Movescrow needs mobile-specific features:
- 📍 **Real-time GPS tracking** (location services)
- 📸 **Camera access** (photo proof system)
- 🔔 **Push notifications** (order updates)
- 📱 **Quick access** (users order on-the-go)
- 🗺️ **Maps integration** (delivery tracking)

**These features are mobile-native and difficult/impossible on web.**

#### 2. **Market Reality in Nigeria**
- 90%+ of users access services via mobile phones
- Food delivery apps are mobile-first (Uber Eats, Chowdeck, Gokada)
- Mobile data is more accessible than desktop internet
- Users expect mobile apps for logistics services

#### 3. **Competitive Landscape**
All major competitors are mobile-first:
- ✅ Chowdeck (mobile app)
- ✅ Gokada (mobile app)
- ✅ Uber Eats (mobile app)
- ✅ Bolt Food (mobile app)

**You cannot compete without a mobile app.**

#### 4. **Development Efficiency**
- Flutter = Build once, deploy to iOS + Android
- Website can be built later (or use Flutter Web)
- Mobile app is the core product
